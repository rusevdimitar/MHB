Nuget problems:
	- if dll is not extracted to lib folder and you've deleted all .dll copies on your hard drive trying to force it to refresh - go to %userprofile%\.nuget and delete the package!!!

		for some reason it does not work with the snk extracted from the pfx!!!
		:: Extract public key to snk required to use with ilasm

Cannot deserialize lists of objects in Xml
	Awful problem ! Sometimes the list returns just 1 item (although there are many), sometimes it's null.
	If one of the nested classes has incorrectly decorated array/list attributes, everything will be broken and you'll never find what's the cause
	SOLUTION:
		Note XmlType and XmlArray and XmlArrayItem:
		[XmlType("item")]
		[DataContract]
		public class ZembroConnection
		{
			[XmlArray("phoneNumbers")]
			[XmlArrayItem("item")]
			[DataMember(Name = "phoneNumbers")]
			public List<string> PhoneNumbers { get; set; }
		}
